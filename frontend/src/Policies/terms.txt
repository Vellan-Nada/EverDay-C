Introduction
These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a binding agreement between you and ZENIT ONLINE (doing business as Zenit) ("Zenit", "we", "us" or “our”). They govern your access to and use of Zenit's websites, and services (the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.
You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization and that "you" includes the organization.

Changes
We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice (for example, via the website, email, or this page). The updated Terms will be effective on the stated date. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

Privacy
Our handling of personal data is described in our Privacy Policy. We only use your data as necessary to operate the Services, provide features you enable, and comply with law.

Acceptable Use
No unlawful, infringing, harmful, deceptive, or abusive activity.
No reverse engineering, scraping, automated collection, or circumventing access controls.
No attempting to overload, disrupt, or interfere with the Services.

User Content
You retain ownership of content you create, upload, or provide to the Services ("User Content").
You grant us a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, process, transmit, and display User Content as needed to provide the Services, maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve the Services as described in the Privacy Policy. We do not claim ownership of your User Content. We do not use your User Content to train artificial intelligence or machine learning models.
You are responsible for your User Content and for ensuring you have necessary rights to provide it. 

Paid Features and Billing
Some features require a paid subscription. Prices, billing cycles, and applicable taxes are shown at checkout. If you enroll in a subscription, it auto-renews at the then-current price unless you cancel before the renewal date via your account or platform settings.
Payments are processed by our payment partner (Stripe); we do not store full payment card details. Subject to applicable law, fees are non-refundable except where we are legally required to provide a refund.

Termination
You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms, if needed to protect the Services or other users, or where required by law. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends, but provisions intended to survive (including ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and governing law) will continue.

Disclaimers and Limits
The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither Zenit nor its affiliates will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the Services. Our total liability for all claims in any 12-month period will not exceed the amounts you paid to Zenit for the Services in that period.

Governing Law and Venue
These Terms are governed by the laws of Malaysia, without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Zenit submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia for any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.
