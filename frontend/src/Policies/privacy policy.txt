These processors act on our instructions to provide the Services.
Service providers are contractually bound to process data only on our instructions and with appropriate safeguards. We do not sell your personal data.

Cookies
Zenit uses cookies and similar technologies to ensure our Services function correctly.

You have the right to control your cookie preferences; you can manage or disable them through your browser settings or our website’s cookie preference tool, though please note that disabling essential cookies may prevent you from accessing features.

We use industry-standard security to protect your data. No system is perfectly secure, so also protect your account with strong credentials and device hygiene.
Encryption in transit and at rest for core services.
Role-based access controls and audit logging.
Incident response procedures and periodic reviews.

Data Retention
We retain personal data while you have an account and as needed to provide the Services or meet legal requirements. Content you delete is removed from active systems.
